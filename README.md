# Sketch-Gallery


Welcome to the Sketch Gallery website! This project is a showcase of artwork built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It features a secure user authentication system that grants different privileges to owners and regular users. Let's dive into the details:

**Features**

User Authentication: I've implemented a robust login system that distinguishes between two user roles: owners and regular users.

Gallery Display: The website offers a visually pleasing display of sketches and artwork, providing users with an immersive viewing experience.

Owner Privileges: Owners are granted special privileges, allowing them to add and delete images from the gallery. This ensures control and curation of the content.

User Access Control: Regular users can enjoy viewing the images without the need to log in, creating a seamless and inclusive browsing experience.

**Getting Started**

Before you start exploring the Sketch Gallery website, ensure you have the following:

Prerequisites: Node.js and npm should be installed on your local machine. Additionally, set up a MongoDB instance for database storage.
